# Space Wars!! (Alien Shooter Game with PyOpenGL + GLUT)

A classic top-down alien shooter built entirely with **PyOpenGL** and **GLUT**.  
Every element — ships, bullets, power-ups — is drawn using **custom rasterization algorithms** (Bresenham’s line, midpoint circle, semicircle), rendered as `GL_POINTS`.  
No sprites. No textures. Just pure OpenGL primitives.

## Overview

**Space Wars!!** is a 2D alien shooter game where you:
- Control a player ship at the bottom of the screen.
- Shoot falling alien ships to score points.
- Collect or avoid power-ups that affect gameplay.
- Manage lives and survive as long as possible while the difficulty increases.

The game uses:
- Orthographic projection: `glOrtho(0, 800, 0, 600, -1, 1)`
- Custom rasterization: Line and circle algorithms
- GLUT event loop for rendering, input handling, and timers.

## Features

- **Pure OpenGL Primitives**  
  No external images or sprites — everything is algorithmically drawn.

- **Custom UI Buttons**  
  Restart, Pause/Play, and Quit buttons drawn directly in OpenGL.

- **Dynamic Difficulty**  
  Enemy fall speed increases with score; slowed down by collecting speed power-ups.

- **Power-Ups and Penalties**
  - Star → shoot for +100 points  
  - Plus → increases bullet size  
  - Minus → decreases bullet size  
  - Speed → slows down falling enemies  
  - Love → grants extra life

## Gameplay Rules

- **Scoring**
  - +1 point for shooting an alien ship  
  - +100 points for shooting a Star  

- **Lives**
  - Start with 3 lives  
  - Maximum lives: 10 (can increase with Love)  
  - Lose 1 life if:
    - 5 enemies reach the bottom, or  
    - 5 misfires (missed bullets or pressing invalid keys while unpaused)  

- **Difficulty**
  - Enemy fall speed increases (`sp += 0.01`) with each alien kill  
  - Collecting a Speed power-up reduces speed (`sp -= 0.1`)
